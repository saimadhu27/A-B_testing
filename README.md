# A-B_testing
This is an A/B test with a mobile game, Cookie Cats.
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding!

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention and game rounds.


# Mobile Games A/B Testing Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying A/B testing to analyze user behavior in a mobile gaming context. The goal is to determine whether specific changes or features introduced to a subset of users have a statistically significant impact on their engagement or revenue generation.

## Key Objectives

- Conduct A/B testing analysis on provided datasets.
- Assess user behavior and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Draw actionable insights to improve decision-making in mobile game development and marketing.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Imported and cleaned datasets related to user activity and game performance.
   - Explored basic statistics and visualized data distributions.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Pre-processed data for compatibility with statistical tests.
   - Identified control and test groups.

3. **A/B Testing Procedure:**
   - Formulated hypotheses regarding user behavior changes.
   - Selected appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, z-tests) to compare control and test group metrics.

4. **Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Conducted tests to assess statistical significance.
   - Visualized results to highlight trends and differences between groups.

## Results

- Key metrics analyzed include:
  - User engagement rates.
  - Revenue per user.
  - Retention rates.

- Findings suggest that [insert key result or trend, e.g., "the new feature increased retention by X%"].

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy (for statistical tests)

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and the effectiveness of new features or changes. By leveraging data-driven decisions, mobile game developers can enhance user experiences and optimize revenue.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook to review the detailed analysis.
3. Modify and adapt the notebook for your own A/B testing needs.
